# PHP Examples

I had to teach myself PHP at work so I've decided to compile a few examples of what we use PHP for. 

Becuase my boss has been writing in PHP since its beginning 20 years ago, all of our backend is currently written in PHP. I am still using PHP for newer projects(because I want to keep things cohesive and so that my boss can quickly understand/debug/change my code if need be), and hopefully these examples, especially any tcpdf examples that I post since I had a rough time working with tcpdf, will help someone else in a similar position.
